## 🚀 AgentOps Hackathon

### 📌 About
Given a Nasdaq or NYSE ticker of your choice, this AI agent will conduct a thorough analysis to help you understand why the company's stock is doing well or not. This AI agent will check the following:
-If competitors are doing things that could impact your company's status.
-If recent political activity or government regulations could help or harm the company's status.
-If the CEO's recent actions could impact the way the company is being led.
-If the company's most recent earnings report provides insight into company performance.
